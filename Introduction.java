    1. Data Structure describes you, how to store data in memory so that computer can perform operations on data efficiently.
    2. Operations - DRUD
    3. Time complexity > Space complexity
    4. Types of DS -
        a. Array -
            Contiguous memory allocation allowed.
            Store in only one data type not all data types allowed at one time.
        b. LinkedList
            It solve contiguous memory allocation problem
        c. Stack
            insertion and deletion from top
            Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
            Ex. Undo Operations (ctrl+Z)
        d. Queue
            Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
            Used in applications like CPU scheduling
        e. Tree
                    20
                    /\
                   /  \
                  21   45
                 /      \
                /\      /\
              32 43    60 78
              Ex. File structure
        f. Graph
            Ex. Facebook (Matual friends)
        g. Hashing
            Technique to map data to a fixed-size table (hash table) using a hash function.
            Allows fast access to data, usually in constant time O(1).

        h. Advantages of Array -
            a. Contiguous memory allocation
            b. Access Time T(n)=O(1)
            c. Can store multiple data of same type using single variable.

        i. Disadvantages of Array -
            a. Insertion time complexity T(n)=O(n)
            b. Deletion time complexity T(n)=O(n)
            c. Size of array known advance
            d. Wastage of memory if data is not stored as per the size of array declared.

         j. Applications of Array -
            a. Searching
            b. Sorting
            d. Matrix Operations
            e. Image preprocessing
            f. Can implement stack, queue, tree, graph.
